- ✅ Settings menu with audio controls (music toggle, SFX toggle, voice toggle, volume slider)
- ✅ Habitat selection screen with progress tracking
- ✅ Game screen with canvas and UI overlays
- ✅ Math problem interface with visual representations

### 2. CSS Styling (`css/styles.css`)
- ✅ Comprehensive styling for all game screens
- ✅ Responsive design for different screen sizes
- ✅ Child-friendly color scheme and typography
- ✅ Interactive elements with hover effects
- ✅ Progress bars and achievement displays
- ✅ Settings toggles and volume controls

### 3. CSS Animations (`css/animations.css`)
- ✅ Animal-specific animations (bunny hop, penguin waddle, etc.)
- ✅ UI feedback animations (correct/incorrect answers)
- ✅ Screen transitions and loading effects
- ✅ Celebration and achievement animations
- ✅ Math problem visual animations
- ✅ Accessibility considerations (reduced motion support)

### 4. Audio Management (`js/audioManager.js`)
- ✅ Complete audio system with Web Audio API
- ✅ Background music for different habitats
- ✅ Sound effects for game interactions
- ✅ Text-to-speech voice narration
- ✅ Audio settings management (volume, toggles)
- ✅ Synthesized sound generation for demo purposes

### 5. Main Game Controller (`js/main.js`)
- ✅ Game state management
- ✅ Screen navigation system
- ✅ Event handling for all UI interactions
- ✅ Progress tracking and save/load functionality
- ✅ Habitat unlocking system
- ✅ Badge and achievement system

## 🔄 Missing Core Components

### 1. Math Engine (`js/mathEngine.js`)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Problem generation system
- ❌ Answer validation logic
- ❌ Difficulty progression
- ❌ Visual problem representation
- ❌ Math concepts: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, equations, exponentials

### 2. Game Engine (`js/gameEngine.js`)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Canvas rendering system
- ❌ Game loop and animation management
- ❌ Sprite management
- ❌ Input handling
- ❌ Collision detection

### 3. Scene Manager (`js/sceneManager.js`)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Scene transitions
- ❌ Game state management
- ❌ Resource loading
- ❌ Performance optimization

### 4. Habitat Implementation (`js/habitats/bunnyMeadow.js`)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: First habitat implementation
- ❌ Animal animations and interactions
- ❌ Habitat-specific math problems
- ❌ Visual storytelling elements

## 🎯 Next Steps for Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Math Engine
1. **Problem Generation**: Create math problems for each habitat
2. **Answer Validation**: Implement checking system
3. **Visual Representations**: Generate visual aids for problems
4. **Difficulty Scaling**: Progressive difficulty based on age group

### Phase 2: Game Engine
1. **Canvas Setup**: Initialize HTML5 Canvas rendering
2. **Animation System**: Create smooth animal animations
3. **Input Handling**: Mouse and keyboard interactions
4. **Resource Management**: Asset loading and caching

### Phase 3: Habitat Implementation
1. **Bunny Meadow**: First habitat with addition/subtraction
2. **Character Animations**: Bunny hopping and carrot counting
3. **Math Integration**: Connect math problems to habitat story
4. **Progress Tracking**: Problem completion and scoring

### Phase 4: Testing and Polish
1. **Browser Testing**: Chrome compatibility
2. **Performance Optimization**: Smooth 60fps gameplay
3. **Educational Testing**: Age-appropriate difficulty
4. **Bug Fixes**: Edge cases and error handling

## 🚀 Ready for Code Mode Implementation

The architectural foundation is complete. The game structure, styling, and main controller are fully implemented. The remaining task is to create the core game logic files that will make the game functional.

**Critical Path**: MathEngine → GameEngine → SceneManager → BunnyMeadow → Testing
